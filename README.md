# Personal Contribution - Juejia Yang

As the technical leader of the Personal Finance Manager project, I took the lead in designing and developing the Data Analysis module. I also established a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the system's quality and reliability. Below is a detailed account of my key contributions:

## Core Module Development

### 1. Architecture Design of Data Analysis Module
- Designed and implemented an MVC-based architecture for the Data Analysis module, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities
- Developed a data adapter layer to efficiently transform raw transaction data into visualization-friendly formats
- Designed an extensible chart generation interface to support seamless integration of various chart types

### 2. Core Feature Implementation
- Implemented single-month expense analysis with pie charts to visually represent category distributions
- Developed multi-month trend analysis using line charts to display income, expense, and balance trends
- Designed and implemented an expense prediction algorithm to forecast future spending based on historical data
- Built quarterly analysis capabilities with bar charts to compare expenditure across different quarters

### 3. Technology Selection and Integration
- Evaluated and integrated JFreeChart library for data visualization
- Designed data processing pipelines to ensure efficient analysis of large datasets
- Implemented customizable chart styling to enhance visual appeal and data interpretability

## Testing Framework Establishment

### 1. Unit Test Coverage
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for the Data Analysis module with over 90% coverage
- Designed edge case test scenarios to ensure system robustness under various conditions
- Implemented automated testing workflows for continuous integration environments

### 2. Testing Toolchain Setup
- Introduced JUnit 5 as the primary testing framework
- Integrated Mockito for dependency mocking to ensure test independence
- Configured JaCoCo for test coverage analysis

### 3. Quality Assurance Measures
- Established code review processes to enforce coding standards and best practices
- Designed performance test cases to optimize critical data processing workflows
- Implemented exception handling tests to improve system fault tolerance

## Technical Leadership & Team Collaboration

### 1. Technical Guidance & Training
- Conducted training sessions on JFreeChart and data visualization techniques for team members
- Shared design patterns and best practices to elevate the team's technical capabilities
- Mentored junior developers in resolving technical challenges

### 2. Cross-functional Collaboration
- Worked closely with UI/UX team to ensure optimal presentation of analytical results
- Collaborated with backend team to optimize data APIs for improved performance
- Participated in product requirement discussions to provide technical feasibility analysis

### 3. Project Management
- Defined detailed development plans and milestones to ensure on-time delivery
- Tracked project progress and proactively addressed risks and issues
- Organized code reviews and technical sharing sessions to foster team communication
