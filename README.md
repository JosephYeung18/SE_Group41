# Personal Contribution - Yuxuan Liao

In the **Personal Finance Manager** project, I was mainly responsible for the development of the transaction entry and details display parts, which are crucial for users to record and view transaction information. The following is a detailed account of my key contributions:

## Core Module Development

### 1. Transaction Entry Panel Development  
- Designed and implemented the `TransactionEntryPanel` class, providing a user-friendly interface for entering income and expense transactions.  
- Implemented two sub-panels for income and expense entries, including:  
  - Category selection  
  - Amount input  
  - Date selection  
  - Note input functions  
- Added an **"Import Transaction Data"** button to support importing transaction data from a CSV file, along with clear format instructions for users.  

### 2. Transaction Details Panel Development  
- Developed the `TransactionDetailsPanel` class to display transaction history and monthly statistics.  
- Implemented a table to show transaction details, including:  
  - Date  
  - Type  
  - Category  
  - Amount  
  - Notes  
  *(Ensured the table data is non-editable.)*  
- Added functional buttons:  
  - **"View All"**  
  - **"Filter"**  
  - **"Export"**  
  *(To support viewing all transactions, filtering by date/type, and exporting data to CSV.)*  

### 3. Function Implementation  
- **In `TransactionEntryPanel`:**  
  - Implemented input validation (e.g., category selection, valid positive amount).  
  - Refreshed `TransactionDetailsPanel` and `AssetBudgetPanel` post-transaction to display updated data.  
- **In `TransactionDetailsPanel`:**  
  - Calculated monthly income, expenses, and net income, updating labels in real-time.  
  - Exported displayed data to CSV with special character escaping for data correctness.  

## Key Classes  

### `TransactionEntryPanel`  
- Builds the transaction entry interface (income/expense sub-panels + import button).  
- Handles user input events (e.g., adding transactions, importing data) via `TransactionController`.  
- Refreshes dependent panels (`TransactionDetailsPanel`, `AssetBudgetPanel`) after operations.  

### `TransactionDetailsPanel`  
- Builds the transaction display interface (summary panel + transaction table).  
- Manages button events (filtering, exporting) and fetches data through `TransactionController`.  
- Updates UI components (table, summary labels) dynamically.  

## Testing and Quality Assurance  
- Conducted **manual testing** on `TransactionEntryPanel` and `TransactionDetailsPanel` to verify:  
  - Input validation.  
  - Button functionality.  
  - Data display accuracy.  
- Ensured code stability through rigorous logic checks and edge-case handling *(despite no automated tests)*.  

## Team Collaboration  
- Aligned panel designs with the **system's overall UI/UX**.  
- Supported teammates by:  
  - Sharing `TransactionController` interfaces.  
  - Clarifying data formats for integration.
